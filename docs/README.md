## Documentation Rules

- Keep this folder frontend-focused.
- Keep one source of truth per topic.
- Update API docs when frontend request contracts change.
- Update architecture docs when request, form, schema, or state-management rules change.
- Update feature docs when user flows, route behavior, or backend dependencies change.
- Put temporary analysis in issues or PR notes, not permanent docs.

New documentation should use the structured folders above. Avoid adding loose
markdown files directly under `docs/` unless they are index files such as this
one.
