# Frontend Architecture

This document is the source of truth for implementing Dwelve frontend code.
Agents must follow it before adding backend requests, forms, schemas, or
data-fetching code.

## Backend Request Architecture

All backend requests must use the server-side request stack. Do not add ad-hoc
`fetch` calls in components, hooks, or pages.

Required layers:

1. `src/lib/api/backend.ts`
   - owns the low-level `backendJson` helper
   - reads `DWELVE_API_BASE_URL`
   - serializes JSON bodies
   - adds query params
   - applies request timeouts
   - parses backend error bodies
   - validates successful responses with Zod when a schema is supplied

2. Feature endpoint modules
   - auth and school endpoints live in `src/app/(authentication)/_lib/api.ts`
   - route-specific backend calls live in the nearest route `_lib` folder
   - endpoint functions must have intention-revealing names such as
     `createSchoolRequest`, `listNotificationsAction`, or `getSchoolRequest`
   - endpoint functions must pass a Zod `responseSchema` for every JSON response
     that the UI relies on

3. Authenticated backend calls
   - use `authedBackendJson` from `src/app/(authentication)/_lib/backend.ts`
   - it attaches the session access token
   - it refreshes tokens once on HTTP `401`
   - do not manually attach bearer tokens outside this helper

4. Server actions
   - mutations from client UI must go through `next-safe-action`
   - actions live in route `_lib` files or `src/app/(authentication)/_lib/actions.ts`
   - actions must convert backend/internal errors into safe user-facing messages

5. Client hooks
   - use `@tanstack/react-query` for client mutations, cache invalidation, and
     paginated reads
   - use keys from `src/lib/query/keys.ts`
   - hooks should call server actions, not the backend URL directly

Forbidden patterns:

- direct `fetch("http://localhost:5000...")` in components, pages, or hooks
- browser-visible `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` for private API calls
- copying bearer-token logic into feature code
- trusting TypeScript-only casts for backend JSON
- hard-coding request URLs in UI components
- adding Axios or another request client unless this document is updated first

## Library Responsibilities

Use the libraries already installed in this project for their assigned jobs:

| Purpose | Required library / location |
|---|---|
| Runtime request/response schemas | `zod` |
| Form schemas and form validation | `zod` with `@hookform/resolvers/zod` |
| Form state | `react-hook-form` |
| Server-action boundaries | `next-safe-action` via `src/lib/safe-action.ts` |
| Client cache, mutations, invalidation, pagination | `@tanstack/react-query` |
| Encrypted httpOnly session cookie | `jose` in the authentication session code |
| UI primitives | existing shadcn/Radix components in `src/components/ui` |
| Icons | `lucide-react` |
| Class composition | `cn` from `src/lib/utils.ts` |
| Dates and relative display | native `Intl` or existing date helpers before new libraries |

Do not install a new library for one of these jobs unless there is a concrete
gap and this architecture document is updated in the same change.

## Schema Placement

Place schemas where their ownership is clearest:

- form input schemas: route-local `_types/_schemas`
- backend response schemas shared by feature endpoints:
  - auth/school: `src/app/(authentication)/_lib/api.schemas.ts`
  - root feature payloads: nearest route or shared `_types/*.schemas.ts`
- derived UI-only types can stay in `_types/index.ts`

Backend response schemas should be permissive only at the edges. Use
`.passthrough()` for backend-owned extra fields such as timestamps, but require
fields the UI depends on.

## Environment Variables

Use server-only environment variables for private API requests:

```env
DWELVE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api/v1
SESSION_SECRET=...
```

`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables are visible in the browser. Use them only for values
that are intentionally public, such as a Google OAuth client ID.

## Validation Before Handoff

For code changes, run:

```txt
npm run lint
npm run build
```

When a change depends on the NestJS backend contract, also smoke-test the
relevant endpoint or verify the matching backend controller/service/DTO in
`D:\IT\projects\Dwelve\backend_nestJS`.
