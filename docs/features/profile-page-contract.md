# Profile Page Backend Contract

This is the backend handoff for the frontend profile page. Do not implement the
page by changing backend assumptions from the frontend. Use these endpoints with
the authenticated request helper and Zod response schemas.

All routes are under:

```txt
/api/v1
```

## Endpoints

```txt
GET    /profile
PATCH  /profile
PATCH  /profile/avatar
PATCH  /profile/school-profile
POST   /profile/change-password
GET    /profile/sessions
DELETE /profile/sessions/:sessionId
```

Every endpoint requires a bearer access token. `GET /profile` works without a
selected school, but selected-school details are returned only when the token has
school context.

## Profile Payload

Use `GET /profile` as the page bootstrap request.

      }
    }
  ],
  "notificationStatus": {
    "hasUnread": false,
    "unreadCount": 0
  }
}
```

If no school is selected, `selectedSchool` is `null`.

Role profile variants:

```jsonc
{ "type": "ADMIN" }
```

```jsonc
{
  "type": "TEACHER",
  "teacherId": "teacherProfileId",
  "phone": null,
  "bio": null,
  "classes": [],
  "classCount": 0
}
```

```jsonc
{
  "type": "STUDENT",
  "studentId": "studentProfileId",
  "studentCode": null,
  "phone": null,
  "classes": [],
  "classCount": 0
}
```

## Mutations

### Update Account Name

```txt
PATCH /profile
```

```json
{
  "fullName": "Jane Doe"
}
```

Response is the full `GET /profile` payload.

### Update Avatar

```txt
PATCH /profile/avatar
```

Use `multipart/form-data`.

Fields:

```txt
avatar       optional JPEG, PNG, or WebP file, max 2 MB
removeAvatar optional boolean string, "true" to remove current avatar
```

Do not send both `avatar` and `removeAvatar=true`. Response is the full
`GET /profile` payload.

### Update School Role Profile

```txt
PATCH /profile/school-profile
```

Requires selected school context.

Teacher request:

```json
{
  "phone": "+998901234567",
  "bio": "Math teacher"
}
```

Student request:

```json
{
  "phone": "+998901234567"
}
```

Admins do not have teacher/student profile fields. Do not show this form for
admins. Response is the full `GET /profile` payload.

### Change Password

```txt
POST /profile/change-password
```

For users who already have password login enabled:

```json
{
  "currentPassword": "old-password",
  "newPassword": "new-password"
}
```

For users without an existing password, such as Google-only accounts:

```json
{
  "newPassword": "new-password"
}
```

On success:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "tokens": {
    "accessToken": "...",
    "refreshToken": "..."
  }
}
```

Store the returned tokens and treat older refresh tokens as revoked.

### Sessions

```txt
GET /profile/sessions
```

```jsonc
{
  "sessions": [
    {
      "sessionId": "session-id",
      "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0 ...",
      "ipAddress": "::1",
      "createdAt": "2026-07-07T00:00:00.000Z",
      "expiresAt": "2026-07-14T00:00:00.000Z",
      "isCurrent": true
    }
  ],
  "count": 1
}
```

```txt
DELETE /profile/sessions/:sessionId
```

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "revokedCurrent": false
}
```

If `revokedCurrent` is `true`, clear local tokens and route to login.

## UI Rules

- Do not display role selection on the profile page.
- Use `account.authMethods.password` to choose between `Set password` and
  `Change password` UI.
- Do not expose password hashes, token hashes, invite tokens, or raw refresh
  tokens.
- Email editing is not supported in v1. Show email as read-only.
- Use initials as fallback when `avatarUrl` is `null`.
- Use `memberships` for school switcher context; use the existing auth
  `POST /auth/select-school` route to switch active school.
- Hide teacher/student role-profile edit controls when `roleProfile.type` is
  `ADMIN`.

## Error Handling

```txt
400 invalid DTO, invalid file, no mutation fields, unsupported role-profile field, missing current password
401 expired/invalid auth or wrong current password
403 missing/invalid selected school context
404 session not found
```

Use backend messages for developer logging, but keep end-user text friendly and
non-leaky.
